Question:
- Entr√©e: the user is required to input the number of rows and columns of the two matrices, and then judge whether the two matrices can be multiplied. 
If they can be multiplied, the result of the matrix multiplication is calculated and output in the matrix format; if not Multiply, it will prompt the user 
that the matrix is incompatible and exit the program.Before we start, we should know a matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns can be represented by a 
two-dimensional array such as int matrixA[2][3] and how to multiple 2 matrices. 
- The product of two matrices is AB where Cij = Sigma(d, k = 1)AikBkj
